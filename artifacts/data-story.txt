Using software to match records together via addresses (and regex) are good, but have some limitations. Our proposal with GeoMatch is to utilize geolocation to bring them together, with the aid of Geocoded National Address File or Google Geocoding API. They may be done automatically, or may require human input. For the latter, crowdsourcing through volunteers may be a cost-effective way to achieve this.
